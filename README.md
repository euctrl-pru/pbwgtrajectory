# Trajectory-based assessment of operational performance

The Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) is a multi-regional expert group 
aiming to foster the joint understanding and advancing the state of the art of operational 
performance assessment of air navigation services and air transport.

This repository/workspace serves as a joint playground in support of the **initial** 
development and refinement and PBWG discussions on developing/refining methods to
assess vertical flight efficiency.
