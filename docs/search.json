For practical reasons the code is jointly developed using the {tidyverse} family. The latter supports readability/development of code for analysts without extensive coding/scripting experience.\n\n\n\n\nSchäfer, Matthias, Martin Strohmeier, Vincent Linders, Ivan Martinovic, and Matthias Wilhelm. 2014. “Bringing up OpenSky: A Large-Scale ADS-b Sensor Network for Research.” In, 8394."
