# "Preamble/Front Matters" {.unnumbered}

The PBWG is a multi-regional group aiming to foster the application of performance monitoring and benchmarking of air navigation services and air transport under the ICAO GANP.

This Technical Note summarises the (initial) development and refinement of trajectory based analytics.\
As a first application use case, the group is interested in studying **vertical flight efficiency** in the arrival and departure phase.

To support the development an open trajectory data set is established for a representative subset of the operations studied by the PBWG.\
The "playground" data is based on a regular data dump provided by Opensky Network[@schaeferosn2014].

This project is developed as a *quarto book* on top of the *R/RStudio eco-system*.
For practical reasons the code is jointly developed using the *{tidyverse}* family.
The latter supports readability/development of code for analysts without extensive coding/scripting experience.
